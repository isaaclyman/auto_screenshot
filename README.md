**auto_screenshot** grabs screenshots from your Flutter app on multiple platforms (iOS and Android).
It has two parts:

1. A command-line wrapper over Flutter's integration_test package that lets you specify which
   emulators to run on, then runs them on your machine while you make pancakes or whatever.
2. Library methods that let you insert screenshot-taking commands into your integration tests
   with a single line of code.

Seed data is supported. If you use go_router, you can specify a test very easily.

## Getting started

You'll need to have the following installed, with the indicated binaries available in your PATH:

- Flutter - `flutter`
- xcode (only available on MacOS) - `xcrun`
- Simulator (comes bundled with xcode)
- Android SDK Command-Line Tools - `emulator`
- Java - `java`

To install, add `auto_screenshot` to your dev_dependencies in pubspec.yaml.
(Run `flutter pub get` if your IDE doesn't do it for you.)

If you don't have integration tests yet, follow the instructions at
https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction.

## Commands

- `dart run auto_screenshot`: Starts booting up simulators, running integration tests, and collecting screenshots.
- `dart run auto_screenshot:list_devices`: Lists all the valid device names you can use in the auto_screenshot configuration.
- `dart run auto_screenshot:validate`: Validates your auto_screenshot configuration without running any tests.

## Configuration

Add a section like the following to your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
auto_screenshot:
  devices:
    - iPhone 8 Plus
    - iPhone 13 Pro Max
    - iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation)
    - iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (5th generation)
    - Pixel_3a_API_33_arm64-v8a
    - Pixel_5_API_33
```

If your integration tests are in `<project root>/integration_test` and you want screenshots to be
written to `<project root>/auto_screenshot`, that's all the configuration you need.

- `devices` - (required) an array of device names. These must be exact and not contain any typos. You can get
  a list of valid device names by running `dart run auto_screenshot:list_devices`. For iOS, this assumes you've
  installed xcode and any simulators you want to use.
- `test_path` - (optional) path from the project root to your integration test folder OR file. Defaults to `integration_test`.
- `output_folder` - (optional) path from the project root to the desired screenshot output folder. Defaults
  to `auto_screenshot`.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Support

Issues are welcome. Please don't ask me to increase the scope of this project unless you're willing to do the work, file the PRs, and join the maintenance team. auto_screenshot is meant to run on MacOS and capture screenshots from iPhone and Android emulators (not physical devices). It does not place the results in a frame, add text or background images, or upload assets to any app store.

## Development

Build autogenerated JSON maps:

`dart run build_runner build`
